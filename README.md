**University Administrators 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓:**

- **Actionable Insights:** 📊 Mindsight provides a comprehensive dashboard with clear and easy-to-understand visuals about student well-being. This empowers administrators to make data-driven decisions and implement targeted interventions and support programs.**z
